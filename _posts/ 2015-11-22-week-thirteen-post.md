title: Week Thirteen Post!
---

In this week of the class we had our final project due, Life. In this project we had to simulate Conway's game of
life using abstract classes. This project was quite similar to the previous project, Darwin, but in this one we had
to make use of inheritence. The overall solution to the problem was not very difficult, but the issues we dealt
with using inheritence were a bit troublesome. In java inheritence is well defined and intuitively implemented.
With c++ there are varioius situations that must be considered before confirming you have implemented your 
inheritence correctly. 

In lecture we have been going through different examples of inheritence and comparing those ideas to that of 
java. Overall, it seems that in java inheritence is a lot more simple compared to c++. The lecture format is still
the same, and professor Downing calls on students to answer questions. This keeps everyone active and paying 
attention to the lecture.

All that is left in this course is a few quizzes and the second test. Most of the material is covered, and I can
confidently say that my c++ skills and understanding have increased largely through the course of the semester. 

Tip of the week:

Great website for learning about c++ destructors.
