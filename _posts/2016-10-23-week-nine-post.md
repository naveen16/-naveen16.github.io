In this week of class we had our projct due. The end result of this phase of the project was to have the website up and running using Digital Ocean to host the domain name. We had to have the content of the page be static html pages, for style we used a bootstrap template to go off of. Aside from that we had to design the backend database schemas for conceptual reasons for now. We also documented the web services that we will be implementing in the next phase using apiary. An example of one of the web services we had was to get a list of all of the artists on the spotify api. 

In the lectures we are learning about relational algebra and trying to implement certain functionalities of it in python. We are still having daily quizzes, and the format of the lecture is the same. Professor Fraij pulls up code and calls on students to explain certain lines of it. This keeps the students engaged and participating in the lecture. 

This project that we are doing currently is great for learning many of the tools that tech industry companies use in everyday development. This is going to prepare is very well for when we are in the real world tech companies. Overall I believe that every aspect of this course is going to better prepare me for the real world.
