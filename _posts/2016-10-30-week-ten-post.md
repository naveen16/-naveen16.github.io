title: Week Ten Post!

In this week of class we had two guest lecturers from companies. The first group was from SpiceWorks, a software company located in Austin. A few of the employees were UT CS grads, and their presentation showed us all about the company and some tips on getting hired into a tech company. The overall culture of the company seemed really nice, it was described as a start up like atmoshphere where everything is casual. The other company that had a few employees come to give a talk was Pariveda Solutions, a software consulting company. This company is different from a normal tech company because they do consulting for clients. As the guest lectureres described their day to day work life, it seemed quite interesting. They mentioned that each employee may work with several different teams based on which project or client they have been designated to, and this is very interesting because you can learn a lot from working with different people as opposed to just working on projects on your own. 

Aside from the lecture, we have been working on phase 2 of the IDB project. This phase calls for us to dynamically get the data for our website, whereas in the first phase we statically put the data on the html pages. This means that we have to set up a database, using postgresql, write web services using flask to obtain the data from the database, and use javascript to dynamically obtain the data using the web services and display them on the web page. 

Overall, this class is teaching me a lot of different technologies and tools that are very useful. I strongly believe that this will help me become a better programmer and become prepared to work in the industry as a software engineer.
