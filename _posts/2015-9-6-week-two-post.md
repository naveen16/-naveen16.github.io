title: Week Two Post!
---

In the last week of class we have mostly been discussing the first project. The first project deals with the Collatz conjecture. Overall, the coding for this project is not very significant. The main point of the project is to get familiar with many different tools for coding. These tools include github, travis CI, and Sphere. 

On the Assignment page there are a list of 39 requirements for the project to be graded. This seems time consuming and tedious, but it is a glimpse of what we are going to have to deal with in the real world industry of computer science. At first while going through the steps it felt overwhelming, but as I proceeded I got more familiar with each of different tools, and it became easier. 

In terms of the lectures, they have been pretty similar to the previous ones. The students are called on to answer various questions on the topic we are discussing for the day. One different aspect is that we began the daily quizzes. These quizzes are 3 question multiple choice answers. They mainly test us on our comprehension of the topics discussed in lecture. Since we only get about a minute to answer each question the difficulty of each quesion is easy to moderate.

This class is a lot of work, but it will prepare you for the real world, and it will make you a much better programmer in the long run. This is the first class where there are so many requirements on each assignment we do, but I am confident it will be highly beneficial to me. 

Tip of the week:
