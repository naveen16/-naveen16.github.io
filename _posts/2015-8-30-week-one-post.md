title: Week One Post!
---

In the first lecture of this course, we went over the syllabus and started talking about the first project. The first project is trivial in nature, but the main point of it is to get used to all the different tools we will be using in the course. This class is almost the same as Professor Downing's object oriented programming. Since that class was very valuable to my progression as a programmer, I believe this course will be a success as well. 

Overall the class seems to be detailed and time consuming, and I believe this will end up being a great class to prepare me for the real world. To become a good programmer you need to practice coding all the time, and this course will force all of us to do so. 

For the first project we will be using python to code the solution. I have used python in the past but only for minimal projects, so I believe that this will be a good learning experience for me. The problem at hand is described by the Collatz conjecture, for every odd number you multiply it by 3 and add 1, and for every even number you divide it by 2. You repeat this process until you reach 1. The cycle length of a certain input is the number of steps it takes to reach 1. Our project is to implement a function to calculate the max cycle length for a range of inputs. Aditionally we need to optimize the solution by implementing a caching mechanism.
