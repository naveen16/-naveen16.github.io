title: Week Nine Post!

In this week of the class we had the Allocator project due. This project was the most difficult so far, because it 
was so hard to debug. The allocator idea was pretty simple and easy to understand, but there were many technicalities 
that caused problems while coding the solution. We had to become very familiar with types and casting in c++ to get
the proper output. Overall, once you get the idea of how casting and types work, the solution was pretty simple.

In the lectures we went over the vector container and its implementation. During class Professor Downing 
went over the test cases for the vector and asked us to implemente a certain functionality. We did this in groups 
first, then we went over the solution as a class. As usual, the students were called on the answer the questions
and go over the solution to the problem.

This course is about half way done and I can already tell I have become a better programmer over this time.
The tools and strategies I have learned in this class will definately help me in the real world tech industry.
