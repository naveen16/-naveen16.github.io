title: Week Thirteen Post!

In this week of the class we had our final project due. We had to implement a search functionality to our website where the user can enter a search query on the home page and it will return a list of partial and direct hits to the query. The results are displayed in a data table. Other than the search functionality, we had to use another teams api in an interesting way. These were the main technical aspects we had to add to the website for this phase of the project. The rest of the work was preparing a presentation and critiquing the other teams api. 

Other than the project, in class we have been learning about refactoring in java. In the lecture, the professor has been going over java code for a Store class to display the benefits of refactorying. The format of the lecture is the same, he calls on students to go over certain lines of code. This keeps everyone engaged and participating.

The course is almost over, we only have one test and a few quizzes. I can confidently say that my programming skills have dramatically increased in this course. Aside from getting more familiar with python, in the website project I learned many other tools that will be of great help to me in the real world tech industry. 

Tip of the week:
