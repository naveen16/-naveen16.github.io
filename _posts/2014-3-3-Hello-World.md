Week One Post

The first two classes of object oriented programming were interesting. Professor Downing has a unique style of teaching. He likes to call on students to answer questions on the topic we are studying rather than him just explaining everything directly to the class. Each student called on must go through the process of solving the given problem out loud and to the class. Professor Downing doesn't expect everyone to know the answer to all of his questions, and he is very helpful when explaining the correct answers. I believe that this format of teching allows the students to absorb more information due to the fact that they are forced to pay close attention to the lecture. Overall the class seems to be detailed and time consuming, and I believe this will end up being a great class to prepare me for the real world. To become a good programmer you need to practice coding all the time, and this course will force all of us to do so. In the two lectures that have been held, we mainly went over basic c plus plus code and learned the java equivalent code, since java is a prerequisite for this class. It was very helpful in learning the syntax and semantics of c++. We learned basic imports, print statements, and testing mechanisms. Even though we are just beginning to learn c++, I already feel like I am getting comfortable with the new language. Learning a language as thorougly and effectively as we are in this course will definately be beneficial to me in the real world.
