title: Week Five Post!
---

In the fifth week of this class we had the second project due. This project was not to hard, in terms of the alrogithm needed to solve it, but there were many other factors and complications that made it time consuming. This project taught us a lot about reading and writing from and to files in python. For the Netflix project, we had to create caches for the training data that was given so that various variables of data could be accessed in constant time. If we created a cache we could post it on the public directory for others to use. 

In lecture, we continued learning about various concepts in python. The format of the lecture was the same as usual. The professor would pull up pieces of code on the overhead and we would go around the class and each student would explain snippets of the code. This form of teaching keeps people engaged and participating. I believe that this is a highly effective form of teaching that other professors should employ. 

Outside of class we had the career fair on Tuesday, and a lot of the students are either looking for internships or full time positions. I beleive that this class is going to prepare me to be successful in the real world tech industry. The tools we are using and practicing are the same ones being used by the tech companies in the industry.
