title: Week Six Post!
---

In the sixth week of this class we learned practiced more on implementing different algorithms in c++. We did this 
by working in groups for a short amount of time then one student would explain the solution to the algorithm. This
way of teaching is great in that it allows us all to get a chance to think about the answer ourselves before
we can see the solution. This really helps us retain all of the information being displayed in the lecture. 

Next week on thursday we are having our first test of the course. It is all c++ coding and will be similar to the 
algorithms we have discussed in class. We didnt have a project this week so that we could have time to concentrate
on studying for the test. Professor Downing suggested that we study in groups and formulate test questions for 
eachother to solve. This seems like a great way to study because it will give example problems that are very
similar to what will be on the test. 

On piazza Professor Downing posted all of the topics we are going to be tested on. This was very helpfult in 
narrowing down what to concentrate on. Some of the topics I am comfortable with and some of them I need to review
a bit more. Having the list of all the topics helps a lot on which topics to concentrate on. I heard the tests in
this course are quite difficult from some upperclassmen, but I hope concentrating on the algorithms we studied
in class will help me be prepared for it.
