title: Week Twelve Post!
---

In this week of the class we had the last project assigned, Life. This project asks us to simulate Conway's game
of Life. We have to define cells and the grid in an object oriented design. We are required to use Abstract classes
and inheritence to solve this problem. We are also restricted in that we cannot use getters and setters. This
project is quite similar to the last one, Darwin, in that we are simulating a life on a grid. The object oriented
design principles used in Darwin will carry over in to this project. The one new aspect of the project we will
have to learn about is the use of Abstract classes and inheritence. 

In the lecture we are going over many examples of the idea of inheritence in c++. We are comparing many of the 
concepts to that in Java. It seems that in Java inheritence is a lot less complicated in behavior. Going over all
of the different examples in inheritence has given me a good understaning of its behavior in c++. 

This course is coming down to the end. We have one project left and one final test left. The majority of the grading
has been completed, and overall this class was fair in grading and high in volume of work. In conclusion, I have 
already gained a lot of useful knowledge from this course.

Great website for learning about Abstract Classes.
