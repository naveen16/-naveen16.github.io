title: Week Seven Post!
---

In the seventh week of this class we had the first test. Leading up to the test there was a lot of material we had
to revise. We had gone over many topics in the classes including iterators, classes, etc. This was 
quite intensive to go over for the test but it was manageable. Professor Fraij posted a list of all of the topics
we had gone over in class and that we would be expected to know for the exam. This was very helpful in studying for
the test because we were able to narrow down which topics we needed to go over more and which topics we were
comfortable with. 

To study for the test I mainly went over the examples on the class github page that we worked through during class.
These were the different algorithms in python that dealt with iterators and python functions. The resources in this class
page were very helpful in covering the material that we needed to know. 

In the classes leading up to the test we went over new topics including range iterator class and decorators. Decorators were not included on the exam though.

Finally we had the exam this week on thursday, and it was an hour and a half long. It was reasonable and doable 
in the time constraints that we had.
