title: Week Three Post!
---

In the third week of this class we had the first project due. The overall code we had to write in the project was 
very little, but the many other requirements make the project time consuming. Because the requirements for the project 
were so strict, we had to be meticulous in following all of the instructions. This course uses github a lot, and I
am learning a lot about it and am becoming very familiar with all of its uses. This bodes well for my future work 
in the industry where companies expect you to be familiar with tools like this. 

The main issue I had with the first project was getting it accepted on Sphere Online Judge. My code was passing all of my test cases and inputs, so I had the correct logic. After trial and error I figured out that Sphere was giving in blank lines as input, so I had to change my code to accommodate that. After adding that fix, my code was accepted on Sphere. The tough thing about Sphere is that it doesnt tell you what your error is or what input is causing the error, so you have to use trial and error to fix bugs. 

Overal the class has stayed the same in structure of the lectures. Professor Fraij calls on students to 
answer questions and to explain concepts. The daily quizzes are still basic questions from the reading, so if you
do the reading you will be good to go for the quizzes. 

Tip of the week:
