title: Week Eleven Post!

In this week of class we had the fourth project due. For this phase of the project we had to implement the database using PostGresql. This entailed scraping data from the api and loading it into the database. For our project we had three tables: Artists, Albums, and Tracks. After the tables were populated we had to define the web services that would access the database. This included 6 web services, 3 to get all artists, albums, tracks, and 3 to get a specific artist, album, or track. These 6 web services were used to dynamically populate our html pages. We used Jquery datatables to format the data on the web page. After that we had to write unit tests for the functionality of the database operations. 

In the lectures we have been learning about sql, most of the stuff is straight forward, the only tricky concept is all of the different joins that can be implemented. The lecture format is still the same, professor Fraij pulls up code on the overhead and asks students to explain what is going on in certain lines of the code. This keeps everyone engaged and participating, which is the most effective way to learn the material.

This course is eighty percent finished, and I can for sure tell that I will come out of this class a better 
programmer. I also believe I will be a lot more prepared for the real world industry of tech companies.
