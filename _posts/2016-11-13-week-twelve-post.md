title: Week Twelve Post!

In this week of class we had the final project to work on. This is the last phase of the website, and the main implementation we have to include in this is to have a search functionality for the whole database. For our website, we have a search box on the front page, and when you search something it will query all 3 database tables and come back with full and partial matches. This was pretty straight forward as we had already had some experience and examples with searching the database in the previous phase of the project. Other than that, we have to create a presentation for the website and present it to the class on the second to last class day. 

In the lectures, we have been learning about SQL, we have been going through examples of queries, inserts, deletes, updates, and sub queries. The format of the lecture is the same as it has been, professor Fraij calls on students to explain what certain lines of code do. This keeps everyone engaged and participating.

This course is coming down to the end. We have one project left and one final test left. The majority of the grading
has been completed, and overall this class was fair in grading and high in volume of work. In conclusion, I have 
already gained a lot of useful knowledge from this course. 

Tip of the week:
