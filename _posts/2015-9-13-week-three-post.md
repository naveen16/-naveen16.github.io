title: Week Three Post!
---

In the third week of this class we had the first project due. The overall code we had to write in the project was 
very little, but the many other requirements make the project time consuming. Because the requirements for the project 
were so strict, we had to be meticulous in following all of the instructions. This course uses github a lot, and I
am learning a lot about it and am becoming very familiar with all of its uses. This bodes well for my future work 
in the industry where companies expect you to be familiar with tools like this. 

One of the lectures this week was done by a former student of Professor Downing. He works at Bloomberg currently and 
he came to give us tips about working in the industry, resume tips, and his daily routines. The tips he gave about
resume's were very informative and enlightening. He is a resume reviewer at Bloomberg, so his opinions were very
credible. This was a great lecture to help all of us students learn more about the industry, and to learn tips 
that will help us succeed in the long run. This gives me more confidence that this class will be the most beneficial 
class at UT in terms of learning about how to succeed in the real world.

Overal the class has stayed the same in structure of the lectures. Professor Downing still calls on students to 
answer questions and to explain concepts. The daily quizzes are still basic questions from the reading, so if you
do the reading you will be good to go for the quizzes. 

Tip of the week:
