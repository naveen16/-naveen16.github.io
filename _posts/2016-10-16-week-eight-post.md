title: Week Eight Post!
---

In this week of class we had the 3rd project assigned. This project is to make a website to model something similar to IMDB. We have to use certain technologies listed on the spec to implement this website. Overall, we have to implement the full stack of the website, ranging from the backend database, the api calls for the data, and the content of the website itself. In addition to that we have to host it on Digital Ocean, a hosting server for domain names. 

This project is a group project and each team has 5 members. For our team, we decided to chose music as our topic for the website. The three pillars chosen were artists, songs, and record labels. We can choose to format the data on the site as we please. Since this is a group project, we have to meet up to work on the project. This can sometimes be hard, as people's schedules may not be flexible, but for my group we have set times for us to meet. 

In the lectures, we have been going over various python concepts and algorithms. Aside from lectures, I have been trying to learn about all of the new and different tools that we have to use for this project. They are very interesting and not too hard to learn, they will definately help in the real world industry of tech companies.
