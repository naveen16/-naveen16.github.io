title: Week Six Post!
---

  In the sixth week of this class we learned about function parameters in python. We went through all the different tricks and ways you could pass parameters to a function. These included having variable names in the function definition, using dictionaries to associate variables to the value, and unpacking dictionaries to get them to work. The tricks here were straightforward for the most part, there were only a few "gotcha's" when learning which syntax and sematics would work and which ones wouldnt work. 

  We also went over what topics would be needed for the first midterm coming up on Thursday during class. Professor Fraij posted on piazza all the topics and ideas we would need to know for the test. He also is allowing us to write up a page of notes to use during the test as a cheat sheet. I believe that this will be very helpful for getting some of the tricky syntax and semantics of python. Professor Fraij told us that the test would mainly consist of coding up the solution to a given problem in python. In addition to that we would have to refresh our knowledge on the readings from the syllabus as there would be a few questions on that from there. 

  Overal in this class I am learning python well, and I am learning a lot of tools that will be useful for me in the real works tech industry. This will end up being one of the most useful classes I take at UT.
