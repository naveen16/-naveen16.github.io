title: Week Four Post!
---

In the fourth week of this class we learned about exceptions and pointers. Professor Downing's meticulous style of 
teaching the material has definately helped me grasp the material a lot better. He still does the same calling of 
students to answer questions about the material being covered for the day.

We also had the second project assigned at the beginning of the week and it is due in 10 days. The code for this 
project seems to be a bit more complicated than the previous one. Also, for this project we have to come up with 
out code by ourselves, Professor Downing did not give us any code to begin with. This will make the project
a bit more complicated but will help us learn more in the long run. For this project we are encouraged to work
in pairs and use the practices of pair programming to solve the problem. This is another technique that this class
teaches us that will definately be higly beneficial to all of us in the industry. Pair and team programming 
are a large part of working in a company, therefore this will help us get used to that and will allow us to 
succeed in the real world. 

The career fair for the college of natural science is coming up next week, and Professor Downing has clearly 
expressed to us the importance of attending that and trying to get an intership for the summer. Overall, he is a
great professor to have if you want to be prepared for the real world.
