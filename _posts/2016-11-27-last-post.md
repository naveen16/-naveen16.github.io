In the last week of the class we had the final test of the course. It was similar to that of the first one and it was
representative of the material we had covered in class. For the first test I didnt prepare very much because it was just
writing algirhtms which doesn't require too much studying. For this second test I went through all of the examples and
exercises on the class github page. This approach seems to be the way to go, because I absorbed a lot more of the information
and material that we would be tested on. 

The class was manageable and very structured. The whole syllabus and schedule was planned out perfectly and we 
covered every piece of materieal we intended to. Overall I am confident I have gained a great amount of knowledge 
and experience in python. In addition to learning python I learned a lot of new software tools. I became very familiar with 
github, travis CI, and many other software development tools. 

Overall I would highly reccomend this class to all computer science major students who are looking to learn software engineering
concepts, and who also want to learn the tools and practices that big tech companies use for software development.
I believe this class has more than prepared me to work in the tech industry of today.

Tip of the week:

Great website for learning about github tools.
