title: Week Two Post!
---

In the last week of the class we went over a few different optimization techniques for the collatz problem. One included using a 'meta cache' to store the max cycle values for ranges of size 1000 and use that as reference when computing all the other ranges. We also went over the pythong code to detect if a number is prime or not. In doing this we also made various optimizations to the code and got it to work. We also had our first and second quizzes in the course last week. The questions are pretty basic, and some are based directly from the readings. A few of them were tricky, but on the whole they were mostly straight forward. 

As far as progress on the first project, I have all the code written and it seems to work properly, but I am getting a runtime error on Sphere. I am continuing to debug this to find out the issue. The tough thing about trying to get the code accepted on sphere is that when you have an error it doesn't give a specficic explanation of the error. This causes debugging the code to become a lot harder. 

In the next week of the class, we will be continuing to work on the collatz project which is due on Thursday. In the lecture I suspect we will be going over more examples of python related code. I am exited for the rest of this course to learn all the new and interesting technologies we will be using for the projects.
