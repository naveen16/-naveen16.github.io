title: Week Five Post!
---

In the fifth week of this class we had the second project due. This project was a little more complicated than the 
last project. The algorithm to solve the problem was a little more complex and what made it hard was the use of 
pointers in C++. We had to store data in arrays and in C++ you have to deal with pointers whereas in java you don't.
Another aspect of this project that made it more difficult than the last one was the fact that we had to come up with
all of our code from scratch. In the last assignment we were given a template of classes and functions and we just
had to fill in the functions. In this project we had to design the structure of the classes and functions.

In one of the lectures we had a guest speaker, who works at the Jet Propulsion Labratory in Pasadena, California.
He basically told us what it was like working at his office, and the atmosphere of the work environment. This 
lecture was very interesting and informative on many of the aspects of the real world. The work he and his 
colleagues do was very interesting, he had various video clips displaying the different aspects of his projects.

In the other lectures we learned about pointers in C++. At first the concept of the pointers was confusing, but
after going over it in class it makes a lot more sense.
