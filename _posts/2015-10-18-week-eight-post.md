title: Week Eight Post!
---

In this week of class we had a new project assigned. We were assigned to implement our own allocator. We were
given a template file Allocator.h which contains various functions and variables. Our job was to implement the 
missing functions in the file and to write test cases to test the valididty of our allocator. This project seems 
interesting and very functional for work we will end up doing in the real world. 

In class we had lecure about arrays and containers. The class format is still the same, Professor Downing calls
on students to answer questions about the topics being discussed. We also work in groups during class to implement
small functions or classes that we go over after. This style of class is very helpful for learning the material
because you have to be paying attention at all times. 

In our disucssion about arrays we learned many of the rules c++ has for pointers and array access. Going through all
of the possible situations of usage for arrays really helps us get a better understanding of the language and its 
uses. We also learned about containers in c++. During class we worked in groups and implemented a vector_type class.
This really helps us get a better understanding of how the pre implemented containers work. 

Tip of the week:
