title: Week Four Post!
---

In the fourth week of the class we have been going over various snippets of python code to learn more about the syntax and semantics. In the classes, Professor Fraij pulls up snippets of code and asks students to explain what is going on in each line. This style of teaching keeps everyone gauged and participating. This in turn helps every one learn more and benefit from the lectures. 

Aside from the lectures we have been working on our second project, Netflix. In this project we are supposed to take training data, and come up with a mechanism for predicting customer ratings for movies on Netflix. This is a group project so we can work with a partner to do this project using pair programming. This is a highly useful skill to learn and become good at, because in the real world of the tech industry, many projects are worked on in teams and not individually. As far as the project, this one is much more complicated than the last one and requires more thought. Also, we were not given template of functions to fill out, so we have to design the solution by ourselves for this project. 

Also the college of natural sciences career fair is coming up on next Tuesday, and Professor Fraij has expressed to us how important attedning is. For those of us looking for internships and full time jobs, this is the best way to get in to contact with companies. Overall I feel as if this course is helping me become better prepared for the real world tech industry.
