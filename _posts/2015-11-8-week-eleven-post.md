title: Week Eleven Post!
---

In this week of the class we had our fourth project due, Darwin. This project turned out to be the most difficult 
project out of the 4 that we had. The solution to the basic problem of the assignment was relatively simple, but
we had many restrictions on our code which made it a lot more complicated. We had to design Darwin's world
with out using getters and setters. Most of the project required communicating between the three different classes
Species, Creature, and Darwin. We had to strategically design the variables and methods so that we could solve
the problem without using getters and setters.

In the lectures, we finished up containers and moved on to inheritence. In the friday lecture, professor Downing
compared the semantics, syntax, and concepts of inheritence between java and c++. The differences were not very 
abundant but a few were suttle. Java inheritence seems to be a little bit more simple compared to that of c++.

This course is eighty percent finished, and I can for sure tell that I will come out of this class a better 
programmer. I also believe I will be a lot more prepared for the real world industry of tech companies.
