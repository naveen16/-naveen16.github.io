title: Week Ten Post!
---

In this week of the class we were assigned the next project, Darwin. This assignment instructed us to implement and
simulate Darwin's World. In order to do this we need to design multiple classes and we were restricted to not use
getters and setters. This project was mostly based on designing classes, in the other projects the spec was 
extensively documented and every class and function was spelled out for us. 

From the second project on, we were allowed and encouraged to have a partner for the projects. Working with partner 
makes the whole process of doing the project easier and more efficient. It also gives us great practice in working 
with other people, which is a key component of workplace projects. This is one of the many aspects of this class
which are preparing us for the real world tech industry. 

Overall this class has stayed steady in the amount of work. Projects are given for 10 days and they have all been 
manageable in that time frame. There is one more project and the second test left in this course, in addition to the 
quizzes.
